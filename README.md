RNA-seq pipeline includes Quality Control, rRNA filtering, Genome Alignment using HISAT2, and STAR, and estimating gene and isoform expression levels by RSEM, featureCounts and Salmon. 
Alternatively, Kallisto or Salmon could be used for quantifying abundances of transcripts based on pseudoalignments, without the need for alignment.
